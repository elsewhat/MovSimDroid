        MovSim is a microscopic road traffic simulator. The simulator implements different car-following models of different model categories like time-continuous models, iterated maps and cellular automata. Recently, we added a microscopic model for cross-country skiing. Lane changes are modeled with the general MOBIL strategy based on accelerations.
        \n\n
        MovSim is intended as a research tool for model investigation and comparison. Our goal is to model and simulate all basic traffic situations and discrete decision makings like lane changes, reacting to a traffic light, yielding, overtaking on rural roads etc. in a generic way and therefore applicable to the implemented models.
